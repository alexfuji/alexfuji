Hi I am alexfuji. A great manga, anime and games lover. An otaku, if you want to call me that. 
Additionally I am working as a web/fullstack developer. 
I love to write Typescript/Javascript and make things pretty with CSS/Sass. But I also can work with php and of course sql if necessary.
I try to keep up with technology and read a lot of different blog posts or watch videos from conferences on youtube. Besides staying up to date, I also like to get to know different views and opinions on the topics, that are interessting for me.
